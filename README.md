# tripcamp-react-express-project

Welcome to the tripcamp-react-express-project! (https://www.tripcamp.us)

## What is this project about
To a normal non-technical everyday user, this is a website to host camping sites, accommodations (homestay) or any beautiful getaway locations anywhere. This work is originally intended as an App Academy personal student work. The source original websites to clone and get inspired from are: Hipcamp and AirBnB.

To a technical person, this is a full-stack application that serves and presents a dynamic frontend website using React/Redux to the normal users, from an express Node.JS backend server referencing a database of objects like users, spots, reviews... through sequelize and PostgreSQL...

## Most notable Technologies used
    1. Node.JS, Express
    2. PostgreSQL, Sequelize
    3. React/Redux/JSX (Javascript Extension)
